      I feel proud to be a part of Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology (VSSUT), Odisha, situated at the foothill of world famous Hirakud dam, with a glorious history of more than half a century. The VSSUT, Odisha was formed in the year 2009 by converting University College of Engineering (UCE), the first Engineering College of Odisha, Burla to a non-affiliating Unitary University.

      The University occupies nearly 300 acres of prime land in Burla. Indeed, the contribution from the Irrigation Department of Odisha was the decisive element in determining the location of this University.

Burla is located at 21°30′N 83°52′E21.5°N 83.87°E. It has an average elevation of 173 metres (567 feet). The town lies at one end of Hirakud Dam which is located around 2 km north-west of the town.
